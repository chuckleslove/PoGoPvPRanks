# PoGoPvPRanks
Generate database tables for all possible PvP ranks.


To Run:
Clone project
npm install mysql
Fill in database info near the top of PvPRank.js
node PvPRank.js

Should take maybe 10 minutes or so to generate both tables with all rows, it's a lot of data and it will let you know when it's done.
